- 👋 Hi, I’m @smccaronis
- 👀 I’m interested in making maps with QGIS and linking them to economic models to understand environmental constraint on human activities!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python and translating my ArcGIS skills to QGIS.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything about freshwater and business.
- 📫 How to reach me: Still new to GitHub so send me a message if that's possible. If not, then send me an email at sean.s.mccarthy@gmail.com.
